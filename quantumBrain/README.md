# Quantum Brain

_The **Quantum Brain** is a next-generation photonic neuromorphic quantum computing system inspired by human brain function, specifically wavefront signal propagation observed in EEG data. Neuromorphic systems unify memory and computation, and this one is no different, however, this one utilizes photonics using cutting-edge materials and logic architectures to emulate processing similar to that of the brain._

## Terminology

If you are familiar with neuromorphic computing, skip this paragraph; otherwise, continue reading. Neuromorphic computing describes a kind of computational architecture based on or inspired by the brain. Many neuromorphic architectures use analog computing with memristors. Memristors are a basic circuit component that remembers the current that just passed through it and will have a variable resistance based on said current. It “remembers” the current, so it “remembers” what resistance value it will have, hence memristor. One aspect of neuromorphic computing that differentiates it from classical von Neumann computational architectures is that it does not operate on a clock. Another aspect of neuromorphic computing is that the computation and the memory are in the same location, which is the intention for this system as well. Components are only powered when they are being used, otherwise, they are off. All these factors lead neuromorphic computing to be incredibly energy efficient, and neuromorphic architectures are especially good when it comes to running neural networks and machine learning algorithms.

If you are familiar with photonic computing, skip this paragraph; otherwise, continue reading. Photonic computing uses light particles (photons) rather than electrons to perform operations and transfer information. Photonics is involved in fiber optic communications in data centers, telecommunications, the internet, and WiFi. Recently, Nvidia announced a hybrid electronic-photonic AI chip for data centers. Photonic computing is not new, neither photonic quantum computing, nor photonic neuromorphic computing are original, however their implementation here is what makes this architecture so promising.

## Quaternary Logic

Computation occurs using quaternary logic, offering greater encoding efficiency compared to binary systems, and drawing inspiration from nature’s own encoding schemes (e.g. DNA’s ATCG and RNA’s AUCG). In this system, it would be 0,1,2,3. Quaternary-based logic is not a new concept, however, it is not utilized often. It is relatively simple to convert between binary and base 4; using two bits for one quaternary "quadit" (quadit being a classical bit that is not binary and is instead quaternary). However, that is for the sake of making this something safe, for the sake of national security, avoiding misuse, minimizing replicability, etc. Neither space taken up nor energy consumption would be minimized in the case of using two bits rather than one "quadit". Now, the process of making a "quadit" would be difficult, but possible. It would necessitate having 4 distinct voltage states, or 2 voltage states and 2 other states in the case of a CMOS architecture. For this photonic system, there are many options, whether wavelengths, polarization, phase shifts, or intensity.

Information would be encoded in quaternary storage and via a combination of transistors and memristors, as has been demonstrated in non-photonic neuromorphic computing, the memory and processing can exist in the same location.


Quaternary logic is used in the analog and digital processing layers for increased encoding efficiency. Photonic qubits currently operate using binary superposition states, though the architecture is extensible to higher-dimensional qudits (e.g. ququarts) in the future.

## Signal Propagation & Context Encoding

The photonic neuromorphic quantum computer uses algorithms based on human brain patterns. Using a combination of electroencephalograms (EEGs) to monitor real people doing calculations/tasks, and then making algorithms based on their brain wave patterns, one could use wavefront signal propagation to mimic brain wave patterns. Additionally, by investigating EEG neurodynamics, it becomes possible to emulate neuromorphic spatial-temporal information processing. I was unfamiliar with wavefront signal propagation until I read a blog from a company called Analog Physics, as such the blog has been cited at the bottom [1]. Conceptually, I think that designing an algorithm by copying a brain pattern will allow for algorithms that are more human in nature, and I hope that this will make the algorithms more powerful long-term.

Data encoding in the brain is based on patterns and synapse weightings, and every individual's pattern-based encoding of that information is not the same. Additionally, the brain has a mechanism through which synapses know the context of the task being performed and through said mechanism, signals are sent down various branches with the most intense signal being the one that is the most relevant. In order to emulate the synapses “knowing” what the context of a task is, this architecture will make use of what I would call, “filters,”  which use advanced materials, such as metamaterials, photonic waveguides, plasmonic structures, and polarizers (waveplates or otherwise). Using photonic memristors, a signal filtered from one activation point will have a color, or wavelength which can be filtered by each of the metamaterials that are inside of the waveguides, which would allow for the filtering of information by category, or type, then additional information could be filtered via combinations of polarizers where, for example, a horizontally polarized light beam is filtered out by the vertical polarizer and vice versa. 

Using a combination of photonic memristors, light polarization, metamaterials, polarizer filters, plasmonic structures, different colors of light, and possibly additional properties of light that can be filtered (i.e. phase), the synapses or photonic memristors have context-aware routing (CAR). With this context-aware routing, the artificial synapses of the quantum brain would be familiar with the kind of information they are receiving and whether it is relevant to them, a form of conditional signal flow, the same way that the (human) brain works. 

One aspect of the CAR is that it will be able to dynamically adjust its filters during operation. This is computationally powerful, as it allows for reconfigurable logic and memory wherein the same physical pathway can implement different logic operations at different times, and different filters can exist on either side of any given memristor. With this, adaptive routing is made possible, which is akin to synaptic plasticity in the brain. Additionally, contextual memory could be updated in real-time by reprogramming the filters. There are several technologies that allow for this dynamic adjustment, including tunable metasurfaces, electro-optic modulators, and thermally or optically switchable metamaterials.

Information would be encoded in a quaternary storage and, via a combination of transistors and memristors—as demonstrated in non-photonic neuromorphic computing—memory and processing can exist in the same location.

## Architecture

A system of photonic qubits/ququarts, each with **n** photonic memristors attached. Those memristors connect to other qubits/ququarts, leading to step-based logic and interconnectedness, the same way that neurons have synapses connecting them to other neurons. The important part is that the signal from the memristors is analog and therefore noisy and unrefined, so it will need to be transformed into a digital signal to be refined by digital logic and then sent to the qubit. As such, the architecture will be data filters (CARs) -> connected waveguides -> photonic memristors -> digital logic -> qubits/ququarts. 

For the entanglement of the stationary photonic qubits/ququarts, a secondary waveguide will serve as a targeted delivery pathway, on top of the first waveguide, which will allow photons to bypass the logic to entangle the qubits/ququarts with this mediator photon. This process of entanglement is a variation of entanglement swapping or mediated entanglement, in addition to resembling measurement-induced entanglement.

## Implementation

It is worth mentioning that the architecture being described would be best implemented in three dimensions rather than two. A 3D layout would allow for significantly greater interconnectivity/synapse density between photonic qubits, memristors, and filters, which would enable reduced signal latency and a closer approximation of biological neural structures. However, this level of dense three-dimensional photonic integration is currently far beyond technological capabilities and may remain infeasible for the foreseeable future. 
As such, a two-dimensional implementation will serve as the initial development platform. While less optimized in terms of physical density and interconnect geometry, a 2D format would still allow for all of the core architectural features to be tested and demonstrated—including context-aware routing, quaternary logic, and signal propagation mechanisms.

Notably, the **Quantum Brain** architecture, despite its name, is modular in quantum integration:

- It can be deployed with or without photonic qubits.
- Even without quantum elements present, the system still offers an ultra-fast, energy-efficient, analog-weighted neuromorphic computing substrate.
- For short-term development, implementing the architecture with quaternary digital logic in place of quantum components may be more feasible.

This flexibility will allow for progressive implementation: from photonic neuromorphic systems with classical output, to hybrid electro-optic logic, and ultimately toward full quantum co-processing.

## Applications

The architecture described in this section holds significant promise beyond theoretical computation. Its structure, unifying both memory and logic, analog context-awareness, and potential quantum computation—enables some novel capabilities that go far beyond what can be done with traditional silicon-based systems.

### Robotics and Embodied Intelligence

Systems built, even partially, upon this architecture could lead to robots with physically-integrated learning and perception where:
-	The same pathways used for memory are used for computation, therefore lower latency and energy consumption.
-	Filtering and contextual gating occur in-line with the signal flow, not in isolated chips or decision modules, so as the light travels, it would immediately be shaped by the context.
-	The robot’s sensors and processing substrate would effectively be one and the same, with context-aware photonic filtering replacing what would traditionally be a software-level control flow, this could lead to reflexive and adaptive behavior.

A system like this would allow the robot’s “body” to interpret its own context, not just respond to it, enabling higher degrees of adaptivity, especially in uncertain, unfamiliar, or dynamic environments.

### Neural Networks and AI on Neuromorphic Quantum Photonics

Running neural networks on a substrate like this would allow hardware and software to train simultaneously, where:
-	Memristive weights adapt in-place, in real time. This could be the basis for hardware-level learning.
-	Filtering structures could evolve alongside network weights, training not only how it responds, but effectively training what the system pays attention to. This means that the system knows what inputs are irrelevant at any given time.
-	Digital and photonic logic could encode both probabilistic weighting and deterministic steps, all in the same layer.

This could yield algorithmic learning that is deeply entangled physically, which would blur the line between the model and the medium.

### Toward Integrated, Embodied Intelligence and Human Integration

In conventional computing, neural networks and AI are running on hardware. In this system, these algorithms could become software that is embodied in hardware. The separation between the two could dissolve. This mirrors how biological organisms operate: thought, action, memory, and context are not isolated, instead they are interwoven into the same medium, the brain. 

If successfully implemented, even in part, architectures like this may one day support systems with:
-	Real-time, low-energy adaptation
-	Sensory-driven learning and feedback loops
-	Self-organizing internal state representation
-	Long-term storage and dynamic memory tied directly to computation.

The result would not just be faster AI, it would be embodied physicalized intelligence.

Long-term, architectures like this one could become the groundwork for **cybernetic systems**—biologically-integrated devices that are capable of adapting to, interfacing with, or augmenting human neural and cognitive function.

In layman’s terms, the Quantum brain—even only in partial form—may serve as a **precursor to cyborg-class systems**, where both computational and cognitive processing are embedded into bodies, environments, or biological substrates themselves.

Integration like that could support:

-	Brain-computer interfaces with localized adaptive processing
-	Autonomous prosthetics with self-tuning sensory-motor control
-	Robotic extensions that co-evolve with human intention and feedback

> At what point does uploading an untrained algorithm in this system feel less like loading an operating system onto a computer... and more like giving a robot a soul — and then an existential crisis?
